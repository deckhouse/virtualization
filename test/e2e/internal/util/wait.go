// WaitFor waits for a specific event by listening to events related to a resource. WaitFor helps avoid race conditions in test cases when a certain condition may occur very quickly and cannot always be caught using Eventually.
//
// For example,
// the `Migrating` phase of a virtual machine during migration may appear for only about 400 ms and then disappear immediately,
// making it impossible to catch with Eventually, which checks at one-second intervals.
// In this scenario, it’s better to use WaitFor.
//
// Another example:
// if disks were created for a test case and you need to wait until they reach the `Ready` phase.
// In this case, since the disk remains in the Ready phase once it gets there, it’s preferable to use Eventually.
