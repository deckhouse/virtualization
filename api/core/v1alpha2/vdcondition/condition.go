/*
The status transitions of an 'InUse' condition depend on its current usage context:

- If an image creation object (VI/CVI) is detected and its phase is `Pending` or `Provisioning`,
the condition's reason is set to `UsedForImageCreation`.

- If a VirtualMachine is detected and its phase is anything other than `Pending` or `Stopped`,
the condition's reason is set to `AttachedToVirtualMachine`.

- If the VirtualMachine is in the `Pending` phase:
  - If any of the conditions `VirtualMachineIPAddressReady`, `ProvisioningReady`, or `VirtualMachineClassReady` are `False`,
    the condition's reason is set to `NotInUse`.
  - If all these conditions are `True`, the condition's reason is set to `AttachedToVirtualMachine`.

- If the VirtualMachine is in the `Stopped` phase:
  - If there is a state change in progress (indicating a restart) or if the Pod's phase is `Running`,
    the condition's reason is set to `AttachedToVirtualMachine`.
  - Otherwise, the condition's reason is set to `NotInUse`.

- If both a VirtualMachine and an image are detected, it gives priority to the VirtualMachine and sets
the `InUse` condition's reason to `AttachedToVirtualMachine`.
