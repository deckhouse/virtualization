        Fixed live disk migration between storage classes using different drivers. Limitations:

        - Migration between `Block` and `Filesystem` is not supported. Only migrations between the
        same volume modes are allowed: from `Block` to `Block` and from `Filesystem` to
        `Filesystem`.
