    - summary: >-
        The collection of metrics based on conditions has been fixed.
        `AwaitingRestartToApplyConfiguration`, `ConfigurationApplied`, `AgentReady` and
        `FirmwareUpToDate` conditions of the virtual machine are no longer displayed to the user
        unless they contain an issue or an important message. However, this change was not initially
        reflected in the metrics. It has now been corrected.
