  features:
    - summary: >-
        Added the ability to forcefully restore a virtual machine from a snapshot using the
        restoreMode parameter. This parameter has two possible values:

        - Safe - a safe recovery option when there are no conflicts with the virtual machine's
        resources;

        - Forced - a forced recovery option that can be applied to a running virtual machine but may
        lead to destructive consequences if conflicts arise during the recovery process.


        If the forcibly restored virtual disks are used by another virtual machine or the restored
        IP address is reserved by another virtual machine, the recovery process will fail, and this
        will be reported in the VirtualMachineRestore resource status.
