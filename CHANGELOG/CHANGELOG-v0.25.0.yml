        In version v0.25.0, support for the module's operation with CRI Containerd V2 has been
        added.

        After upgrading CRI from Containerd v1 to Containerd v2, it is necessary to recreate the
        images that were created using virtualization module version v0.24.0 and earlier.

    - summary: >-
        An annotation has been added to set the default VirtualMachineClass.

        To designate a `VirtualMachineClass` as the default, you need to add the annotation 

        `virtualmachineclass.virtualization.deckhouse.io/is-default-class=true` to it.

        This allows creating VMs with an empty `spec.virtualMachineClassName` field, which will be
        automatically filled with the default class.
