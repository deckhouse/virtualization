# v1.1.1

## Fixes

[core] Fixed an issue in containerdv2 where storage providing a PVC with the FileSystem type was incorrectly attached via `VirtualMachineBlockDeviceAttachment`.
- [core] Added error reporting in the status of disks and images when the data source (URL) is unavailable.
- [vi] When creating virtual images from virtual disk snapshots, the `spec.persistentVolumeClaim.storageClassName` parameter is now respected. Previously, it could be ignored.
- [vm] Fixed the `NetworkReady` condition output: it no longer shows the `Unknown` state and appears only when needed.
- [vm] Prohibit duplicate networks in the virtual machine `.spec.network` specification.
- [vmip] Added validation for static IP addresses to avoid creating a `VirtualMachineIPAddress` resource with an IP already in use in the cluster.
- [vmbda] Fixed a bug where, when detaching a virtual image through `VirtualMachineBlockDeviceAttachment`, the resource could get stuck in the Terminating state.

## Other

- [observability] Added Prometheus metrics for virtual machine snapshots (`d8_virtualization_virtualmachinesnapshot_info`) and virtual disk snapshots (`d8_virtualization_virtualdisksnapshot_info`), showing which objects they are associated with.

## Security

- [module] Fixed CVE-2025-58058 and CVE-2025-54410

# v1.1.0

## New features

- [vm] Added the ability to migrate VMs using disks on local storage. Restrictions:
  - The feature is not available in the CE edition.
  - Migration is only possible for running VMs (`phase: Running`).
  - Migration of VMs with local disks connected via `VirtualMachineBlockDeviceAttachment` (hotplug) is not supported yet.
- [vd] Added the ability to migrate storage for VM disks (change `StorageClass`). Restrictions:
  - The feature is not available in the CE edition.
  - Migration is only possible for running VMs (`phase: Running`).
  - Storage migration for disks connected via `VirtualMachineBlockDeviceAttachment` (hotplug) is not supported yet.
- [vmop] Added an operation with the `Clone` type to create a clone of a VM from an existing VM (`VirtualMachineOperation` `.spec.type: Clone`).
- [observability] Added the `KubeNodeAwaitingVirtualMachinesEvictionBeforeShutdown` alert, which is triggered when the node hosting the virtual machines is about to shut down but VM evacuation is not yet complete.
- [observability] Added the `D8VirtualizationDVCRInsufficientCapacityRisk` alert, which warns of the risk of insufficient free space in the virtual machine image storage (DVCR).

## Fixes

- [vmclass] Fixed an issue in VirtualMachineClass types Features and Discovery that caused nested virtualization not to work on nodes with AMD processors.
- [vmop/restore] Fixed a bug where the controller sometimes started a restored VM before its disks were fully restored, resulting in the VM starting with old (unrestored) disks.
- [vmsnapshot] Fixed behavior when creating a VM snapshot with uncommitted changes: the snapshot now instantly captures the current state of the virtual machine, including all current changes.
- [module] Fixed an issue with installing the module on RedOS 8.X OS.
- [module] Improved validation to prevent adding empty values for parameters that define storage classes for disks and images.
- [vmop] Fixed garbage collector behavior: previously, all VMOP objects were deleted after restarting the virtualization controller, ignoring cleanup rules.
- [observability] The virtual machine dashboard now displays statistics for all networks (including additional ones) connected to the VM.
- [observability] Fixed the graph on the virtual machine dashboard that displays memory copy statistics during VM migration.

# v1.0.0

## New features

- [vm] Added protection to prevent a cloud image (`VirtualImage` \ `ClusterVirtualImage`) from being connected as the first disk. Previously, this caused the VM to fail to start with the "No bootable device" error.
- [vmop] Added `Restore` operation to restore a VM from a previously created snapshot.

## Fixes

- [vmsnapshot] When restoring a virtual machine from a snapshot, all annotations and labels that were present on the resources at the time of the snapshot are now restored correctly.
- [module] Fixed an issue with queue blocking when the `settings.modules.publicClusterDomain` parameter was empty in the global ModuleConfig resource.
- [module] Optimized hook performance during module installation.
- [vmclass] Fixed core/coreFraction validation in the `VirtualMachineClass` resource.
- [module] When the SDN module is disabled, the configuration of additional networks in the VM is not available.

## Security

- Fixed CVE-2025-47907

# v0.25.0

## Important notes before update

In version v0.25.0, support for the module's operation with CRI containerd V2 has been added.
After upgrading CRI from containerd v1 to containerd v2, it is necessary to recreate the images that were created using virtualization module version v0.24.0 and earlier.

## New Features

- [observability] New Prometheus metrics have been added to track the phase of resources such as `VirtualMachineSnapshot`, `VirtualDiskSnapshot`, `VirtualImage`, and `ClusterVirtualImage`.
- [vm] MAC address management for additional network interfaces has been added using the `VirtualMachineMACAddress` and `VirtualMachineMACAddressLease` resources.
- [vm] Added the ability to attach additional network interfaces to a virtual machine for networks provided by the `SDN` module. For this, the `SDN` module must be enabled in the cluster.
- [vmclass] An annotation has been added to set the default `VirtualMachineClass`. You can designate a `VirtualMachineClass` as the default by adding the annotation
  `virtualmachineclass.virtualization.deckhouse.io/is-default-class=true`.
  This allows creating VMs with an empty `spec.virtualMachineClassName` field, which will be automatically filled with the default class.

## Fixes

- [module] Added validation to ensure that virtual machine subnets do not overlap with system subnets (`podSubnetCIDR` and `serviceSubnetCIDR`).
- [vi] To create a virtual image on a `PersistentVolumeClaim`, the storage must support the `RWX` and `Block` modes; otherwise, a warning will be displayed.
- [vm] Fixed an issue where changing the operating system type caused the machine to enter a reboot loop.
- [vm] Fixed an issue where a virtual machine would hang in the Starting phase when project quotas were insufficient. A quota shortage message will now be displayed in the virtual machine's status. To allow the machine to continue starting, the project quotas need to be increased.

## Other

- [vmop] Improved the garbage collector (GC) for completed virtual machine operations:
  - Runs daily at 00:00.
  - Removes successfully completed operations (`Completed` / `Failed`) after their TTL (24 hours) expires.
  - Retains only the last 10 completed operations.
