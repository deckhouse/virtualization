## Description

The `virtualization` module allows you to declaratively create, start, and manage virtual machines and associated resources.

The command line utility [`d8`](https://deckhouse.ru/documentation/v1/deckhouse-cli/) is used to manage cluster resources.

## Usage scenarios

- Running virtual machines with an x86-64-compatible OS.

- Running virtual machines and containerized applications in the same environment.

- Creation of DKP clusters.

{{< alert level="info" >}}
If you plan to use `virtualization` in a production environment, it is recommended to use a cluster deployed on physical (bare-metal) servers. For testing purposes, it is allowed to use the module in a cluster deployed on virtual machines but with nested virtualization enabled on them.

## Architecture

The module includes the following components:

- A module core (CORE) that is based on the KubeVirt project and uses QEMU/KVM + libvirtd to run virtual machines.
- Deckhouse Virtualization Container Registry (DVCR), a repository for storing and caching virtual machine images.
- Virtualization API (API), a controller that implements a user API for creating and managing virtual machine resources.

List of controllers and operators deployed in the `d8-virtualization` namespace after the module is enabled:

The virtual machine runs inside the pod, which allows you to manage virtual machines as regular Kubernetes resources and utilize all the platform features, including load balancers, network policies, automation tools, etc.

The API provides the ability to declaratively create, modify, and delete the following underlying resources:

- Virtual machine images and boot images.
- Virtual machine disks.
- Virtual machines.
