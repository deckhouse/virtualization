// ReusableEnv defines an environment variable used to reuse resources created previously.
// By default, it retains all resources created during the e2e test after its completion (no cleanup by default in this mode).
// Use the `WITH_POST_CLEANUP=yes` environment variable to clean up resources created or used during the test.
//
// When a test starts, it will reuse existing virtual machines created earlier, if they exist.
// If no virtual machines were found, they will be created.
// Only the following e2e tests are supported in REUSABLE mode. All other tests will be skipped.
// - "Virtual machine configuration"
// - "Virtual machine migration"
// - "VM connectivity"
// - "Complex test"
