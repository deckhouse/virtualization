            Describes a virtual disk that can be mounted in `VirtualMachines`. Once the resource is created, only the disk size `.spec.persistentVolumeClaim.size` can be changed, all other fields are immutable.

            A PVC is created under the hood of the resource, into which the data from the source is filled.
