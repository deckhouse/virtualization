                    * `Delete` — this means that a `VirtualMachineIPAddressLease` is automatically deleted when a user deletes the corresponding `VirtualMachineIPAddress`.
                    * `Retain` — if a user deletes a `VirtualMachineIPAddress`, the corresponding `VirtualMachineIPAddressLease` will not be deleted. Instead, it is moved to the Released phase, where its ip address can be manually reclaimed.
