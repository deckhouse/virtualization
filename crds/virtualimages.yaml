            This resource describes a virtual disk image or installation image (iso) that can be used as a data source for new `VirtualDisks` or can be mounted in `Virtuals`.

            > This resource cannot be modified once it has been created.

            A container image is created under the hood of this resource, which is stored in a dedicated deckhouse virtualization container registy (DVCR) or PVC, into which the data from the source is filled.
