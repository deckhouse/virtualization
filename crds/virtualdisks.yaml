            The `VirtualDisk` resource describes the desired virtual machine disk configuration. A `VirtualDisk` can be mounted statically in the virtual machine by specifying it in the `.spec.blockDeviceRefs` disk list, or mounted on-the-fly using the `VirtualMachineBlockDeviceAttachments` resource.

            Once `VirtualDisk` is created, only the disk size `.spec.persistentVolumeClaim.size` can be changed, all other fields are immutable.

                        The name of the StorageClass required by the claim. More info — https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#class-1

                        When creating disks, the user can specify the required StorageClass to create the disk, or not explicitly, in which case the default StorageClass will be used.

                        The disk features and virtual machine behavior depend on the selected StorageClass.

                        The `VolumeBindingMode` parameter in the StorageClass affects the disk creation process:
                        - `Immediate` - The disk will be created and available for use immediately after creation.
                        - `WaitForFirstConsumer` - The disk will be created only when it is used in a virtual machine. In this case, the disk will be created on the host where the virtual machine will be started.

                        StorageClass can support different storage settings:
                        - Creating a block device (`Block`) or file system (`FileSystem`).
                        - Multiple Access (`ReadWriteMany`) or Single Access (`ReadWriteOnce`). `ReadWriteMany` disks support multiple access, which enables live migration of virtual machines. In contrast, `ReadWriteOnce` disks, which are limited to access from only one host, cannot provide this capability.

                        For known storage types, the platform will independently determine the most effective settings when creating disks (in descending order of priority):
                        1. `Block` + `ReadWriteMany`
                        2. `FileSystem` + `ReadWriteMany`
                        3. `Block` + `ReadWriteOnce`
                        4. `FileSystem` + `ReadWriteOnce`

                    * Provisioning - The process of resource creation (copying/downloading/filling the PVC with data/extending PVC) is in progress.
                    * WaitForUserUpload - Waiting for the user to upload the image. The endpoint to upload the image is specified in `.status.uploadCommand`.
                    * WaitForFirstConsumer - Waiting for the virtual machine that uses the disk is scheduled.
                    * Ready - The resource is created and ready to use.
                    * Resizing — The process of resource resizing is in progress.
                    * Failed - There was a problem when creating a resource.
                    * PVCLost - The child PVC of the resource is missing. The resource cannot be used.
                    * Terminating - The process of resource deletion is in progress.
