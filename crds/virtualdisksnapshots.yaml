            Provides a resource for creating snapshots of existing virtual disks, which can be used as data sources for generating new virtual disks

            A `VolumeSnapshot` is created under the hood of the resource.

                    Create a snapshot of a connected virtual machine's disk only if it is possible to freeze the machine through the agent.

                    If the value is set to true, a virtual disk snapshot will be created if at least one of the following rules is met:
                    - the virtual disk is not attached to any virtual machine.
                    - the virtual disk is attached to a virtual machine that is powered off.
                    - the virtual disk is attached to a virtual machine with an agent, and the freeze operation was successful.
