Description: Do not attempt to compile removed BrotliCompress source
 BrotliCompress is not currently used, and including an embedded
 copy of its source could cause false-positives when scanning for
 security issues. This code is stripped from our orig.tar (at the request
 of the Ubuntu security team), so we also need to disable the build.
