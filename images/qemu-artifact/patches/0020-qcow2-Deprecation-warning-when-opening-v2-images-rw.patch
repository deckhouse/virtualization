qcow2 v3 has been around for a long time (since QEMU 1.1/RHEL 7), so
there is no real reason any more to use it. People still using it might
do so unintentionally. Warn about it and suggest upgrading during the
RHEL 9 timeframe so that the code can possibly be disabled in RHEL 10.

The warning is restricted to read-write mode and the system emulator.
The primary motivation for not having it in qemu-img is that 'qemu-img
amend' for upgrades would warn otherwise. It also avoids having to make
too many changes to the test suite.

bdrv_uses_whitelist() is used as a proxy for deciding whether we are
running in a tool or the system emulator. This is not entirely clean,
but it's what is available and the same function qcow2_do_open() already
uses it this way for another warning.
