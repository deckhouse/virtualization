## `001-disable-ro-and-admin-servers.patch`

This patch introduces new flags to enhance the security and control of QEMU services:

- Adds `--no-admin-srv` and `--no-ro-srv` flags to `virtqemud`.
- Adds `--no-admin-srv` flag to `virtlogd`.

These flags allow disabling the read-only and admin servers for `virtqemud` and the admin server for `virtlogd`, respectively, providing better control over the services and reducing potential attack surfaces.

### Affected Sockets

When all flags are set, the following sockets will be disabled:
- `/var/run/libvirt/virtlogd-admin-sock`
- `/var/run/libvirt/virtqemud-admin-sock`
- `/var/run/libvirt/virtqemud-sock-ro`

# Patches

## `002-auth-pid-restriction.patch`

This patch introduces a new security feature for **virtqemud** by utilizing an environment variable to restrict socket connections:

- The `LIBVIRT_UNIX_SOCKET_AUTH_PID` environment variable is used to specify the **process ID (PID)** that is allowed to connect to `virtqemud`.

When this environment variable is set, `virtqemud` will **only accept socket connections from the specified PID**, improving security by ensuring that only the intended process can communicate with the daemon.

### Affected Behavior

- If the `LIBVIRT_UNIX_SOCKET_AUTH_PID` environment variable is set with a valid PID, `virtqemud` will check the PID of incoming connection attempts. Only the process with the specified PID will be allowed to communicate over the socket.
- Any connection attempt from a different process will be rejected.
- If the environment variable is **not set**, `virtqemud` will function as before, accepting all connections without PID-based restrictions.

This feature enhances security by preventing unauthorized access to the socket and mitigating the risk of privilege escalation attacks. It provides a way to control access to the daemon based on the PID of the connecting process, without the need for additional command-line flags.
